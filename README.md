# pyramid-os
a series of disks i found

if you need context, this is where i place documentation for an obscure operating system called "pyramid/os".
anything from notes to unused content to full-on versions of the os will appear here.
documentation is available in the wiki.

(you might as well throw all this out because this is fake)
